# House Price Prediction API

This project is a house price prediction model trained on a small dataset. The model has been saved in a pickle file (`house_price_model.pkl`) and exposed via a Flask API. The API takes in details such as total square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location (rural, suburban, urban) to predict house prices.
